1.  Data Structure Review


    *  OOP pseudoclassical inheritance ie data and functionality
    *  Don't use arrow funcs in class due to arrow funcs not have access to this scope

* Why does these structures matter?
  * *Allow us to control how we access data*
* Array and Objects
  * native data type
  * composites
* Stacks
  * Last In, First Out
* Queues
  * First In, First Out
* Link List
* Hash Tables
  * store/key pairs to an specified array index
  * allows quick retrieval data
  * uses a hash function
  * Collision
    * sometimes you will have to different inputs generate the same value which will cause a conflict aka collision
    * Why do we do?
      * Store the data in a nested object, normally array but depends on your data


1. First ordered list item
2. Another item
⋅⋅* Unordered sub-list.
1. Actual numbers don't matter, just that it's a number
⋅⋅1. Ordered sub-list
4. And another item.

⋅⋅⋅You can have properly indented paragraphs within list items. Notice the blank line above, and the leading spaces (at least one, but we'll use three here to also align the raw Markdown).

⋅⋅⋅To have a line break without a paragraph, you will need to use two trailing spaces.⋅⋅
⋅⋅⋅Note that this line is separate, but within the same paragraph.⋅⋅
⋅⋅⋅(This is contrary to the typical GFM line break behaviour, where trailing spaces are not required.)

* Unordered list can use asterisks
- Or minuses
+ Or pluses
